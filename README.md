# Topdown-Plane-Game
Simple topdown-view game in JAVA where the goal is to make planes/helicopters reach their goals indicated in green. 


## Getting Started
The executable needs Java (JRE) 1.5+ to be launched. To start the game, you can either:
* Click on Game.jar #(contained in the folder /Executable)
* Launch manually Game.jar from command line (java -jar Game.jar on Windows operating systems)

To run the code itself, you can load the project in Eclipse IDE.


### Important note
The code is very partially commented since the version presented on this Git was the result of an universitary project.


### Pre-requisites
* Java (versions above)
* Swing and AWT Libraries
* Enough disk space for game's images.
